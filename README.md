You can check out the live demo of this project at [My Website](https://liveapiks.netlify.app).

**react-crud-liveapi** is a React-based CRUD application that interacts with a live API to manage user data. The app allows users to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations with ease through a simple and responsive interface. Real-time data fetching ensures seamless updates when performing operations.

## Features

- **Create**: Add new users by filling out the form with details like first name, last name, username, password, email, and avatar.
- **Read**: View a list of existing users and their details.
- **Update**: Modify the data of an existing user by selecting and updating their details.
- **Delete**: Remove users from the list by deleting their records.
- **Live API Integration**: All data interactions are made with a live API, ensuring real-time updates and dynamic behavior.

## Instructions

### Important Notes:
- **Add Data First**: Initially, there are 12 pre-existing users in the system. However, these records are **not operable** for CRUD actions. You need to first **add your own data** in the form to perform operations such as updating or deleting.

### Steps to Get Started:

1. **Add New Data**: 
   - Fill out the form with user information and click the **"Add Data"** button to insert new records.
   
2. **Perform CRUD Operations**:
   - Once youâ€™ve added your data, you can perform CRUD actions:
     - **Update**: Click the **"Update"** button to modify any of the added records.
     - **Delete**: Click the **"Delete"** button to remove any record.
     - **Show**: View the full details of a user by clicking the **"Show"** button next to their name.
